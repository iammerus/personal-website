# Building for Scale: Lessons from Managing 100K+ Concurrent Users

When I joined Gfinity to work on the ePremier League platform, I knew we were building something ambitious. What I didn't fully grasp was the scale we'd need to handle when Premier League football clubs' esports teams competed in front of massive global audiences.

The ePremier League brings together all 20 Premier League clubs in competitive EA SPORTS FC™ tournaments, with matches broadcast live and thousands of fans following their teams online. During peak events, we regularly handled over 100,000 concurrent users, all expecting real-time updates, seamless streaming integration, and zero downtime.

Here's what I learned about building systems that can handle that kind of scale.

<BreakoutImage src="/assets/images/posts/pexels-photo-1181671.jpeg" />

## The Challenge: More Than Just Numbers

When people talk about "scale," they often focus on user numbers. But true scale isn't just about concurrent users – it's about concurrent *actions*. During live matches, users aren't just passive observers:

- **Real-time score updates** every few seconds
- **Live chat and reactions** from thousands of fans simultaneously  
- **Tournament bracket updates** as matches conclude
- **Streaming integrations** with broadcast platforms
- **Admin dashboard actions** from race control operators
- **Player profile updates** and statistics in real-time

Each user might generate 10-20 server interactions per minute during peak activity. Suddenly, 100K users becomes over 1 million operations per minute.

## Architecture Decisions That Made the Difference

### 1. **Event-Driven Architecture with WebSockets**

Traditional REST APIs couldn't handle the real-time nature of esports. We implemented a robust WebSocket system with Redis Pub/Sub for message distribution:

```typescript
// Simplified version of our real-time event system
class RealTimeEventHandler {
  private redis: Redis
  private websocketManager: WebSocketManager
  
  async publishMatchUpdate(matchId: string, update: MatchUpdate) {
    // Validate and process the update
    const processedUpdate = await this.processUpdate(update)
    
    // Publish to Redis channel
    await this.redis.publish(
      `match:${matchId}:updates`, 
      JSON.stringify(processedUpdate)
    )
    
    // Redis subscribers in other server instances will pick this up
    // and broadcast to their connected WebSocket clients
  }
  
  async handleRedisMessage(channel: string, message: string) {
    const update = JSON.parse(message)
    const matchId = this.extractMatchId(channel)
    
    // Broadcast to all connected clients following this match
    this.websocketManager.broadcastToRoom(`match:${matchId}`, update)
  }
}
```

**Key insight**: Don't just use WebSockets everywhere. We maintained REST APIs for operations that didn't need real-time updates, which reduced server load and improved reliability.

### 2. **Smart Caching Strategy**

With 100K+ users requesting similar data (tournament brackets, player stats, match schedules), caching was crucial. But naive caching can cause problems at scale.

```typescript
// Multi-layer caching approach
class DataService {
  private redisCache: Redis
  private memoryCache: LRU<string, any>
  
  async getTournamentBracket(tournamentId: string): Promise<Bracket> {
    // L1: Memory cache (fastest, smallest)
    let bracket = this.memoryCache.get(`bracket:${tournamentId}`)
    if (bracket) return bracket
    
    // L2: Redis cache (fast, shared across instances)
    const cached = await this.redisCache.get(`bracket:${tournamentId}`)
    if (cached) {
      bracket = JSON.parse(cached)
      this.memoryCache.set(`bracket:${tournamentId}`, bracket)
      return bracket
    }
    
    // L3: Database (authoritative source)
    bracket = await this.database.getTournamentBracket(tournamentId)
    
    // Cache at both levels with appropriate TTLs
    await this.redisCache.setex(
      `bracket:${tournamentId}`, 
      300, // 5 minutes
      JSON.stringify(bracket)
    )
    this.memoryCache.set(`bracket:${tournamentId}`, bracket)
    
    return bracket
  }
}
```

**The surprise challenge**: Cache invalidation became complex when tournament brackets updated during live events. We implemented a publish/subscribe system for cache invalidation across all server instances.

### 3. **Database Optimization Under Pressure**

Our PostgreSQL database became the bottleneck faster than expected. Here's what we learned:

#### Connection Pooling Saved Us
```typescript
// PgPool configuration that handled our scale
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
  max: 20, // Maximum pool size
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
})
```

But the real game-changer was **read replicas**. We directed all read operations (95% of our traffic) to read-only replicas, keeping the primary database free for writes.

#### Query Optimization Under Load
Some queries that worked fine with 1K users became catastrophic with 100K users:

```sql
-- This query killed performance during peak load
SELECT m.*, p1.name as player1_name, p2.name as player2_name
FROM matches m
JOIN players p1 ON m.player1_id = p1.id  
JOIN players p2 ON m.player2_id = p2.id
WHERE m.tournament_id = $1
ORDER BY m.scheduled_time DESC;

-- Optimized version with denormalized data
SELECT match_id, player1_name, player2_name, scheduled_time, status
FROM match_details_view
WHERE tournament_id = $1
ORDER BY scheduled_time DESC;
```

**Key insight**: Denormalization isn't evil at scale. We created materialized views that were updated asynchronously, dramatically improving read performance.

## The Infrastructure That Kept Us Running

### Load Balancing Strategy

We used a multi-tier load balancing approach:

1. **CDN Layer** (CloudFlare): Static assets and API response caching
2. **Application Load Balancer** (AWS ALB): Geographic distribution
3. **Internal Load Balancer**: Intelligent routing based on server load

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

```yaml
# Our Kubernetes auto-scaling setup
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: epl-api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: epl-api
  minReplicas: 5
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource  
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```

**The learning**: Auto-scaling isn't magic. We had to carefully tune our scaling metrics and ensure our application could handle rapid instance changes without data loss.

## Monitoring and Observability: Our Early Warning System

At scale, you can't wait for users to report problems. We implemented comprehensive monitoring:

### Key Metrics We Tracked
- **Response times** (P50, P95, P99)
- **Error rates** by endpoint
- **WebSocket connection counts**
- **Database query performance**
- **Cache hit rates**
- **Server resource utilization**

### The Dashboard That Mattered

```typescript
// Custom metrics we pushed to our monitoring system
class MetricsCollector {
  async recordApiCall(endpoint: string, duration: number, status: number) {
    await Promise.all([
      this.prometheus.histogram('api_request_duration', duration, { endpoint, status }),
      this.prometheus.counter('api_requests_total', 1, { endpoint, status }),
    ])
  }
  
  async recordWebSocketEvent(event: string, room: string) {
    await this.prometheus.counter('websocket_events_total', 1, { event, room })
  }
}
```

**Critical insight**: The most important metric wasn't server CPU or memory – it was **user-perceived latency**. We tracked how long it took for match updates to reach end users, not just how fast our servers processed them.

## When Things Went Wrong (And They Did)

### The Great Database Lock Incident

During the semi-finals, a poorly optimized query caused a cascading lock situation. Tournament bracket updates froze for 12 minutes while 80K users hammered refresh buttons.

**What we learned**: 
- Always test database queries under simulated load
- Implement circuit breakers for database operations
- Have a rollback plan for every deployment

### The WebSocket Memory Leak

Our WebSocket connection manager had a subtle memory leak that only manifested under high connection counts. After 6 hours of peak load, servers would run out of memory.

**The fix**:
```typescript
// Before: Memory leak in connection cleanup
class WebSocketManager {
  private connections = new Map<string, WebSocket>()
  private roomSubscriptions = new Map<string, Set<string>>()
  
  removeConnection(connectionId: string) {
    this.connections.delete(connectionId)
    // BUG: Forgot to clean up room subscriptions!
  }
}

// After: Proper cleanup
class WebSocketManager {
  removeConnection(connectionId: string) {
    const connection = this.connections.get(connectionId)
    if (connection) {
      // Clean up all room subscriptions for this connection
      for (const [room, subscribers] of this.roomSubscriptions) {
        subscribers.delete(connectionId)
        if (subscribers.size === 0) {
          this.roomSubscriptions.delete(room)
        }
      }
      this.connections.delete(connectionId)
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations That Made a Difference

### 1. **Batch Operations**
Instead of processing match updates individually, we batched them:

```typescript
class MatchUpdateProcessor {
  private updateQueue: MatchUpdate[] = []
  private batchTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null
  
  queueUpdate(update: MatchUpdate) {
    this.updateQueue.push(update)
    
    if (!this.batchTimer) {
      this.batchTimer = setTimeout(() => this.processBatch(), 100)
    }
  }
  
  private async processBatch() {
    const batch = [...this.updateQueue]
    this.updateQueue = []
    this.batchTimer = null
    
    // Process all updates in a single database transaction
    await this.database.processBatchUpdates(batch)
    
    // Broadcast all updates at once
    await this.broadcastBatch(batch)
  }
}
```

### 2. **Intelligent Data Pagination**
For tournament brackets with hundreds of matches, we implemented cursor-based pagination:

```typescript
async getTournamentMatches(
  tournamentId: string, 
  cursor?: string, 
  limit: number = 50
) {
  const query = `
    SELECT * FROM matches 
    WHERE tournament_id = $1 
    ${cursor ? 'AND id > $2' : ''}
    ORDER BY id ASC 
    LIMIT $${cursor ? '3' : '2'}
  `
  
  const params = cursor ? [tournamentId, cursor, limit] : [tournamentId, limit]
  const matches = await this.database.query(query, params)
  
  return {
    matches,
    nextCursor: matches.length === limit ? matches[matches.length - 1].id : null
  }
}
```

### 3. **Smart WebSocket Room Management**
We avoided broadcasting to rooms with no active listeners:

```typescript
class RoomManager {
  private activeRooms = new Map<string, Set<string>>()
  
  joinRoom(connectionId: string, room: string) {
    if (!this.activeRooms.has(room)) {
      this.activeRooms.set(room, new Set())
    }
    this.activeRooms.get(room)!.add(connectionId)
  }
  
  broadcast(room: string, message: any) {
    const connections = this.activeRooms.get(room)
    if (!connections || connections.size === 0) {
      return // Don't broadcast to empty rooms
    }
    
    // Broadcast to active connections only
    for (const connectionId of connections) {
      this.sendToConnection(connectionId, message)
    }
  }
}
```

## The Results: Success Under Pressure

By the end of the tournament season, our platform had handled:
- **100,000+ concurrent users** during finals
- **2.3 million real-time updates** during peak events
- **99.97% uptime** across the entire season
- **Sub-200ms average response times** even under peak load

## Key Takeaways for Building at Scale

### 1. **Plan for 10x Your Expected Load**
If you think you'll have 10K users, plan for 100K. The cost of over-engineering is much lower than the cost of downtime during critical moments.

### 2. **Monitoring Is Not Optional**
Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one. You can't optimize what you can't measure.

### 3. **Test Everything Under Load**
Load testing isn't just about your main application – test your database, your caches, your third-party integrations, everything.

### 4. **Have a Rollback Plan**
Every deployment should be quickly reversible. When you're serving 100K users, you can't afford extended downtime to fix a bad deployment.

### 5. **Embrace Eventual Consistency**
Not everything needs to be immediately consistent. Tournament brackets can have a 30-second delay if it means better performance for live match updates.

## What's Next?

The lessons learned from the ePremier League platform have influenced every project I've worked on since. Scale isn't just about handling more users – it's about building systems that remain performant, reliable, and maintainable as they grow.
